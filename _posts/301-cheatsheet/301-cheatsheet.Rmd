The three laws outlined [here](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/tutorial-case-studies/posts/201-three-laws-vizcom/) provide overarching principled advice, and should serve as a guiding star towards effective visual communication for the quantitative scientist. To further ease their implementation in practice, it helps to distill even more detailed recommendations and to illustrate them concretely.

To this end, we have introduced the Graphics Principles [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet/blob/master/NVSCheatSheet.pdf).This single-page reference sheet is an integral part of this [tutorial](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/tutorial.html). It was carefully designed as a concise and accessible resource for everyday practical use. Yet, it draws from a wide range of sources. We hope that it proves useful for putting the three laws into practice.

The full version is [available](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io) along with corresponding [programming code in R](https://github.com/GraphicsPrinciples/CheatSheet).
